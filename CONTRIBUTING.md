When submitting a pull request (PR), please adhere to the following guidelines:

### General

- Create a new branch from the `main` branch before starting work.
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature, improvement, or bug fix.
- Follow the projectâ€™s code style and guidelines.
- Ensure your changes do not introduce breaking changes unless discussed beforehand.
- If your PR is related to an existing issue, mention it in the PR description using `fixes #issue_number`.
- Provide clear and concise descriptions for your changes.
- If applicable, add tests to cover your changes.
- PRs should not contain unnecessary commits. Squash commits where necessary.

- `<type>` refers to the nature of the change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`).
- `<scope>` is optional but helps clarify what part of the codebase is affected.
- `<subject>` is a concise summary of the change.
